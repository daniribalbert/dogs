# AUTO DOGS

### Project Description
Auto dogs is a sample project that uses the Dog CEO API (https://dog.ceo/api/) to load images of dogs and display them on a list. Everyone loves dogs, right?

## What to  look for?

### REST API
This is handled with the help of Retrofit. The best library to handle that.

### Image Loading
Images are loading using Glide. Fast, powerful and offers caching!

### Koin
Dependecy Injection! Koin provides DI without all the boilerplate from dagger.

### Coroutines
Easy concurrency done with full kotlin support
